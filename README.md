# Go Stream Yourself
This was a massive collaborative effort with a team of members for a school assignment. The project itself is based on [Dave Eggers' The Circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Circle_(Eggers_novel)) and is a streaming platform with a few additional steps. All the parts in this repository are based on their original seperate repositories, and the rtsp server stuff is created by [pedroSG94](https://github.com/pedroSG94). Additional credits can be found below.

For further details on each of the different components in this project, please refer to each component's respective README.
